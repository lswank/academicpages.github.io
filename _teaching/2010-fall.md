In 2010 I was asked to put together a unique experience for students in the University of Utah's College of Fine Arts. With the increasing popularity of the iPhone, there was a rising demand for instruction on how to take advantage of the new mobile paradigm. The most excited folks about this were designers. 

The only trouble was, I was still an undergraduate without a degree. Fortunately, for the Dean of Fine Arts, that was not a problem. I ran this course for two years before moving the course to the School of Computing where more students would find it easier to choose this course as an elective.
