After two years of teaching a more design-focused version of this course to students in the College of Fine Arts, I moved to the School of Computing in the College of Engineering.

The University of Utah still maintains (as of 2018) an archive of my teaching material, including slides and other lecture material.

Here are links to the (2012 course)[https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs4530/2012ios/index.html] and the (2013 course)[https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs4530/2013ios/index.html].
